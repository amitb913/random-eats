# Random Eats (Frontend) CS 546

# Required Dependencies
- Node.js
- Expo CLI (https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)

# Running the App
To run the app, you may either use an iOS/Android simulator (requires XCode or Android Studio, respectively, to already be set up on the machine the frontend is running on) or a physical device with the Expo Go app installed (available on the App Store and Google Play Store). This build has only been tested with iOS devices so far.

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project
3. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
4. Set the `API_URL` variable in Constants.js to the URL of the backend server (e.g. `export API_URL=http://localhost:8000`). (Additional info in Constants.js)
5. Run `expo start` to start the Expo (frontend) server
6. Follow the instructions in the terminal to either run the app on a simulator or a physical device
